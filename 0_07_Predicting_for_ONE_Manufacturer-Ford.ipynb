    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook represents the culmination of a long road of trial and error trying to predict vehicle emissions using neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What has been done until now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct database of inputs and outputs\n",
    "* Remove zeros from data to prevent unnecessary noise\n",
    "* Try Multi Task Learning to predict: $HC$, $CO$, $CO_2$, $NO_X$\n",
    "    * This didn't work\n",
    "* Run a short code trying to evaluate the impact of network size on the predictions\n",
    "    * It was found the effect was minimal at that point, so ONE architecture was chosen: inputs-256-128-64-32-16-output\n",
    "* Try Single Task Learning (normal supervised learning) to predict only HC\n",
    "* Perform a **hyper-parameter** search to find the best possible combination that would reduce the error\n",
    "    * For this a standard error was chosen to evaluate the predictions: MSPE\n",
    "    * The top four were:\n",
    "        * MAPE + LReLU + Adam + 20% dropout\n",
    "        * MAPE + PReLU + Adam + 20% dropout\n",
    "        * R2 + LReLU + Adam + 20% dropout\n",
    "        * R2 + PReLU + Adam + 20% dropout\n",
    "    * The models were predicting **negative** values which made no sense\n",
    "* These top four models were tested for all four pollutants: $HC$, $CO$, $CO_2$, $NO_X$\n",
    "    * To see if one of them could be predicted better than the others and this could provide a clue into the massive errors\n",
    "    * Because in the past notebook the predictions were negative, a ReLU output replaced the Linear output. But this caused all of the predictions to be **zero** for all emissions\n",
    "* The hypothesis was that probably one of the inputs was introducing a VERY negative correlation into the relationship which made the predictions zero. So 18 different data-sets were created, where each was missing **one** input. Models were trained (with a linear output) to see when they generated positive predictions and when they were negative. \n",
    "    * It was found that the following variables made the predictions negative: \n",
    "        * Fuel Code\n",
    "        * Drive System\n",
    "        * Peak_pos (Positive acceleration peaks)\n",
    "        * ETW (Estimated Test Weight)\n",
    "        * a_pos (Positive acceleration mean)\n",
    "        * HP (Horse Power)\n",
    "    * It was impossible to try combinations of two of those variables because there would be around 300 models to test\n",
    "* PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied on the original data-set (with 18 inputs) to see if this algorithm could generate variables that would improve predictions. \n",
    "    * It didn't work\n",
    "* PCA was applied on a new data-set that did not include the **six** variables from above. \n",
    "    * This didn't work either\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will run a test to see if a model can accurately predict emissions for vehicles belonging to **ONE SINGLE MANUFACTURER**. A combination of hyper-parameters will be tried to see if something works: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Activation Functions:\n",
    "    * Leaky ReLU + Linear Output\n",
    "    * Leaky ReLU + ReLU Output\n",
    "    * ReLU + Linear Output\n",
    "    * ReLU + ReLU\n",
    "* Optimizers:\n",
    "    * Adam\n",
    "* Dropout:\n",
    "    * 20%\n",
    "* Loss Function:\n",
    "    * MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)\n",
    "* Scaler:\n",
    "    * MinMax\n",
    "    \n",
    "There will be an analysis of the manufacturers in the data-base and with this, different data-sets to train the models will be created. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Create a data-set with 18 inputs for the manufacturer with the most cars\n",
    "    2) Create 18 independent databases by dropping one input at a time\n",
    "    3) Apply PCA for 99% and 90% to the first database\n",
